## Install

```bash
npm install -g @sandworm/audit
# or yarn global add @sandworm/audit
# or pnpm add -g @sandworm/audit
```

## What You Get

* A CSV of all dependencies, with license, size, and parent info for each package;
* A treemap chart of all dependencies, to help you visualize your bundle size structure;
* A tree chart of all dependencies, to easily grok hierarchies and identified issues;
* A machine-readable JSON output of all the audit data.

## How Sandworm Audits Your Project

Sandworm starts by parsing your app manifest (the content of your `package.json` file), as well as your lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, depending on what package manager you use).

> **Note**
> Make sure that Sandworm runs against the most recent lockfile for your app. The lockfile is treated as the source-of-truth for information about what packages and what versions are currently in use.

> **Warning**
> Sandworm does NOT currently support [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces). You need to run Sandworm against the final built manifest and lockfile.

Sandworm then builds a standardized dependency graph object, representing the hierarhical structure of all your dependencies. The generated graph is enhanced with additional package metadata (like info about licenses, authors, maintainers, etc.). By default, this metadata is obtained from [NPM's registry API](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md), but an offline alternative exists that is able to retrieve less info, but locally, from the `node_modules` directory.

Multiple types of issue scans are then performed:
  * **CVE vulnerabilities** are retrieved via your package manager's CLI, by reading the results of `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or `pnpm audit`.

> **Note**
> Identified vulnerabilities might vary between different package managers.

  * All **dependency licenses** are verified to be valid SPDX, OSI-approved, and compatible with the current project license policy, amongst other license-related checks.

> **Warning**
> When identifying a package's license, Sandworm currently only looks at the `license` field in the manifest file. Reading package `LICENSE` files is on our roadmap.

* **Dependency metadata** is also verified against common indicators of risk or poor quality, such as deprecated packages, or packages with non-registry URLs.

## Run Sandworm In The CLI

To use Sandworm Audit as a CLI tool, simply run `sandworm-audit` in the root directory of your project (or use the `-p` option to indicate the root dir).

```
Options:
      --version          Show version number                           [boolean]
      --help             Show help                                     [boolean]
  -o, --output           The name of the output directory, relative to the
                         application path        [string] [default: ".sandworm"]
  -d, --include-dev      Include dev dependencies     [boolean] [default: false]
  -v, --show-versions    Show package versions        [boolean] [default: false]
  -p, --path             The application path    [string] [default: current dir]
      --md, --max-depth  Max depth to represent                         [number]
```

## Detected Issues List

| Type | Issue | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Vulnerability | All CVEs | Same as CVE severity |

| License | Not licensed for use | `critical` |
| License | License not OSI approved | `low` |
| License | License is deprecated | `low` |
| License | Atypical license | `high` |
| License | Invalid SPDX license | `high` |
| License | Custom license expression | `high` |
| License | License policy violations | Policy severity |
| Meta | Deprecated package | `high` |
| Meta | Uses install scripts | `high` |
| Meta | Has no repository | `moderate` |
| Meta | Has HTTP dependency | `critical` |
| Meta | Has GIT dependency | `critical` |
| Meta | Has file dependency | `moderate` |

## Chart Types

### Treemap
![Sandworm Treemap](https://assets.sandworm.dev/showcase/treemap-snip.png)
* [Sample Treemap for Express@4.18.2](https://assets.sandworm.dev/charts/npm/express/4.18.2/treemap.svg)
* Node colors represent the dependency depth;
* Node surface represents the size of the corresponding directory under `node_modules`;
* A dotted pattern in a node background means the package is a shared dependency, required by multiple packages, and present multiple times in the chart;
* Shared dependency sizes are added to every dependent package, to represent the independent size structure properly; hence, the displayed size might be larger than the actual size on disk;
* A red package background means the package has direct vulnerabilities;
* A purple package background means the package depends on other vulnerable packages;
* Click on a node to make the tooltip persist; click outside to close it;
* When representing deep dependencies, the surface area of certain packages might reach zero, making them invisible.

### Tree
![Sandworm Tree](https://assets.sandworm.dev/showcase/tree-snip.png)
* [Sample Tree for Express@4.18.2](https://assets.sandworm.dev/charts/npm/express/4.18.2/tree.svg)
* Nodes are grouped by color based on the root dependency that they belong to;
* Red text in a package name means the package has direct vulnerabilities;
* Purple text in a package name means the package depends on other vulnerable packages;
* Click on a node to make the tooltip persist; click outside to close it;
* By default, the tree chart has a maximum depth of 7, meaning only seven levels of dependencies will be represented, to keep the output readable; you can override this using the `--md` option.
