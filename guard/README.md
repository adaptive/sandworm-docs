### Summary

* Sandworm Guard intercepts all potentially harmful Node & browser APIs, like arbitrary code execution (`child_process.exec`) or network calls (`fetch`). It knows what packages are responsible for each call.
* Simple obfuscation techniques can confuse static analysis tools, but Sandworm's dynamic analysis will always intercept risky calls at run time.
* You can use Sandworm Guard to:
  * audit your dependencies, monitor activity and permissions, and see what your code is doing under the hood using the Inspector;
  * generate a security profile automatically from your test suite and do snapshot testing against it;
  * secure your app against supply chain attacks by enforcing per-module permissions.
* Install it as an `npm` module in your existing Node or browser app.
* Works in Node v15+ and [modern browsers](https://browsersl.ist/#q=defaults). Beta support for browsers and sourcemaps.

## The permission database project

A longer-term goal for Sandworm is to provide an open, public database of per-package permission requirements, based on:
* running automated tests with Sandworm enabled for public packages;
* anonymous info about requirements collected from real-world apps by the inspector.

For every method call that Sandworm intercepts, the inspector will share the following info:

```json
{
  "module": "CALLER_MODULE_NAME",
  "family": "INVOKED_METHOD_FAMILY",
  "method": "INVOKED_METHOD_NAME",
  "sessionId": "INSPECTOR_SESSION_ID"
}
```

This will make it easier for everyone to audit packages and set up Sandworm. To opt out of sharing data with the community, run the inspector with the `--no-telemetry` option. You can also audit [what's getting sent](https://github.com/sandworm-hq/sandworm-guard-js/blob/main/cli/index.js#L19) and the [server code](https://github.com/sandworm-hq/sandworm-collect).

## How Sandworm is tested

Sandworm has several layers of automated testing:

* Jest is used to run Node.js capture & enforce tests for all supported Node APIs (tests run on Node 16.10 and above). See the `tests/node` directory.
* Playwright is used to run browser capture & enforce tests for all supported browser APIs (tests run on WebKit, Chromium, and Firefox). See the `tests/web` directory.
* Jest is used to run unit tests on the core Sandworm source files. See the `tests/unit` directory.
